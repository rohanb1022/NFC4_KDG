## 🤖 Introduction

Welcome to the **Web3 Academic Credential Ecosystem**, a decentralized platform to issue, validate, and manage academic certificates with full transparency and trust. 

Powered by blockchain and AI, the platform enables:
- Institutions to issue verifiable certificates  
- Students to manage and share credentials  
- Employers to verify certificates instantly  

This is a full-stack project leveraging **Solana smart contracts**, **LLM-based certificate validation**, and **IPFS decentralized storage**, demonstrating the future of secure academic credentialing.
